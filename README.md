BUCKLE
-----------

Buckle is a CSS template meant to be a starting point and standardize projects. It's built loosely on Twitter Bootstrap, uses Normalize, and sticking to my own variation of SMACSS. It's broken into three style types.


This is still very early in development and will grown and expand to slowly become a robust starting point for projects. It's not meant to be used like Twitter Boostrap, as a CSS "Library". It is a framework, but its meant to be modified at its core on a project-to-project basis.

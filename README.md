Buckle 
=======

__version 0.5.0__

Buckle is a CSS template meant to be a starting point for any project -- small or big. It's built loosely like Twitter Bootstrap, uses Normalize, and sticking to my own variation of modular CSS architecture. It's broken into three style types.

This is still very early in development and will grow and expand to slowly become a robust framework without providing too much. It's not meant to be used like Twitter Boostrap -- as a CSS "Library". It is a framework, but its meant to be modified at its core on a project-to-project basis.
